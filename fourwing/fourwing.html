    <h3 id="intro">FOUR-WING ATTRACTOR</h3>

    <p>This attractor introduces a new 3-D quadratic autonomous system, which can generate two coexisting single-wing chaotic attractors and a pair of diagonal double-wing chaotic attractors. More importantly, the system can generate a four-wing chaotic attractor with very complicated topological structures over a large range of parameters. Some basic dynamical behaviors and the compound structure of the new 3-D system are investigated. Detailed bifurcation analysis illustrates the evolution processes of the system among two coexisting sinks, two coexisting periodic orbits, two coexisting single-wing chaotic attractors, major and minor diagonal double-wing chaotic attractors, and a four-wing chaotic attractor. Poincar√©-map analysis shows that the system has extremely rich dynamics. The physical existence of the four-wing chaotic attractor is verified by an electronic circuit. Finally, spectral analysis shows that the system has an extremely broad frequency bandwidth, which is very desirable for engineering applications such as secure communications.</p>

    
      and a system of three ordinary differential equations
      describing the structure as-
      <p> 
        $\left\{ \begin{eqnarray*}
                \frac{dx}{dt}&amp;=&amp; ax+yz \\
                \frac{dy}{dt}&amp;=&amp; b x + cy - xz \\
                \frac{dz}{dt}&amp;=&amp; -z-xy
                \end{eqnarray*}\right.
        $
    </p>
            
    <p>When a = 0.2, b = 0.01, c = -0.4,, a solution curve of this
      system has the shape of four-winged butterly like structure and the
      position of particles will follow a similar path.</p>
